not working calls / view 

    policy 

        scanners -> arrange model -> like filetype each is an object for itself -> tansforming the object before sending it ? 
        settings -> no model is currently set 
        unify API Call -> one API call to get everytinh like http://jdev01:4580/api/policy/getpolicy/
        with this call i should get one object per view i.e one big object for dashboard, one big object for filetype, one big object "who" 
        and so on
        
    channel

        update inputs and outputs 
        input array does not work 
        post not in place -> make service
        read and write mode ? 


Missing API Calls inside Channels
    - Input and Outputs GET ( currently only POST is supported )




http://jdev01:4580/api/Channels/getchannel/id
    inside IoSmbConfiguration 
    SpeedLimit and UserQuota should be oject {value, unit}
    add LocalPathForMediaBurn inside the object

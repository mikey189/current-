not working calls / view 

  reorder channel order -> post not working (see alert message)
  updateChanneName: does the post but then the data that is returned when clicking on one of the item is not pdated (maor)

  toDo: when calling a policy or channel load all views related to it at the same time (dashboard, settings, etc...)


Policy Settings does not update 
ISMB and OSMB : 
AllowMediaBurn is an object not a boolean value {isActive: Bool, RootPath: string}
Speedlimit does not have value only unit ? 
Settings not updating, returning error, always returns the same settings
Who uses this channel -> not call for it at the moment

passing data to the modal inside policy settings 

make connection between facets template and policy/chanenel related data

channel settings not updating -> always the same

General Problem
Facets are general, we need to find a way to make them per channel/policy

Channel Management

On API call receive all info relative to the channel inside channels/getChannel/id
DaShboard info (blocked and no blocked)
topBar info
input and output
settings
who is using this channel: 
  settings do not save, after post it's like nothing has changed
  who uses this channel : binding -> info related to channel and not general 

Policy: 
On API call receive all info relative to the policy inside policy/getpolicy/id
policy top bar
dashboard (sorted top files by : passed, blocked, passed files) -> possible orderBy?

Channel : input and output : sudden issue with layout, weird

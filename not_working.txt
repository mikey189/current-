 
channel Management: 
  reorder channel order -> post not working (see alert message)
  updateChanneName: does the post but then the data that is returned when clicking on one of the item is not pdated (maor)
  ISMB and OSMB : 
    AllowMediaBurn is an object not a boolean value {isActive: Bool, RootPath: string}
    Speedlimit does not have value only unit ? 
    Settings not updating, returning error, always returns the same settingsÂ·
    Who is using this channel: 
        impossible to update channel who is using : error: Value can not be null when the object that is being sent contains Value Property
    settings: 
    Update does not work anymore for some weird reason 


Policies : 

    CDR Facets : 
        impossible to add actions to cdr defaultvalues when they are already set, or to delete them because they are just a string
        and we deal with objects  



General 

Facets 
    We deal with objects when displaying them but then we send strings and dealing with both is not really feasible

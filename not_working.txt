to do 

post filetype (post entire facets)
then check that what I get in return and check that the binding is alright 
 
 currently detection and filetype have no support whatsoever
 detection has no support like : angular.forEach to check if available values already exist

How many maximum labels for graph? currently 15.

Issues : 
when posting policy filetype settings, I get two objects

the first one that is a litteral object and the second one that is an object compaosed of arrays in the form of facets
which one should I send considering the fact that contrary to CDR where values where not booleans, here values or booleans a I can't extrapolate
model state from facets (litteral strings)

the other object, is the object that works with the DOM itself and this recognizable by DOM elements

which one to post ? how can we work with facets when string interpolation is not possible given the fact that in this specific screen (filetype)
we are facing 90 % booleans values ? 


sum up : 
I post two objects for policy facets filetype settings when only one is expected ? 
What object to post ? how to make the binding back? 


Issue is that im not writing into the proper object, instead of writing inside the first object that contains the template, I'm writing into the 
second object that is created on the fly. 

in all other facets we write inside the object that we get (the one that contains the template object as well) and here it seems to 
create an another object. 

On one hand this is what is causing the issue, on the other hand, it's not like the other facets as i do need to recreate
some other object as we are working 90% with booleans.



the two objects creation was due to a typo mistake, it is now resolved

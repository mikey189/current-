not working calls / view 

  reorder channel order -> post not working (see alert message)
  updateChanneName: does the post but then the data that is returned when clicking on one of the item is not pdated (maor)

  toDo: when calling a policy or channel load all views related to it at the same time (dashboard, settings, etc...)


Policy Settings does not update 
ISMB and OSMB : 
AllowMediaBurn is an object not a boolean value {isActive: Bool, RootPath: string}
Speedlimit does not have value only unit ? 
Settings not updating, returning error, always returns the same settings
Who uses this channel -> not call for it at the moment
